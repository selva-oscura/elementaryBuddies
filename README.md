# elementaryBuddies (a.k.a. My Chemical Friendship)
<h3>My Chemical Friendship (initially named 'elementary buddies') is a Chemistry Educational Tool to introduce students to chemistry and the periodic table.</h3>
<p>Written in the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js) with images generated on-site and pulling data from a chemistry API, this app uses a fun and intuitive interface to communicate basic concepts regarding the periodic table, chemical interactions, valence, and other core chemical data. It was developed as a proof of concept for a larger application that could utilize gamification as a means to encourage student learning.</p>
<p>All code for this educational app was written at and for LinkedIn's DevelopHer Hackathon, 14-15 November 2014.</p>
